The BEBI Door Security System project aims to address growing concerns regarding
unauthorized access by implementing a security solution. This project focuses on enhancing
security through advanced biometric authentication, including facial recognition, adaptive access
control, and real-time connectivity. User convenience is prioritized with touchless access options
and an intuitive interface
● Facial recognition: The system shall include facial recognition capabilities for access
authentication.
● Alerts and notifications: The system shall alert the user if anyone tries to access the
door.
● User-Friendly Interface: Development of an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with
touchless access options.
● Real-Time Feedback: Enable users to monitor the security system remotely in real-time.
● Door Access: Unlocking the door when the user gets recognized in the system

This project was made using a raspberry Pi 4 model B along side its camera, user interface
was developed using QT and pyside6 and utilised firebase as a real-time database to enable synchronization
of the collected data between the Raspberry and the user.
